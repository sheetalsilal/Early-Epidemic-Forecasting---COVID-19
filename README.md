# Early-Epidemic-Forecasting---COVID-19

This repository contains the code for a generalised SEIR model used to project cases for two weeks early in the COVID-19 epidemic in South Africa. 
Relying on public data only, and with best known literature at the time, the model made projections for only two weeks into the future. 

All models are simplifications of reality that are designed to describe and predict system behaviour and are justified by the assumptions and data with which they are developed. Model robustness and predictions are likely to be improved as more data becomes available.
